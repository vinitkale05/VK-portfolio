Some of those products worked. Most of them didn't, because the differentiation was purely cosmetic. The underlying logic was identical. The moat was exactly zero." },
      { type: "paragraph", text: "I've been thinking a lot about what makes an AI product actually worth building. Not in the hype sense, but in the sense of: would this exist and be useful in five years, or is it a temporary bridge product that gets absorbed into the model itself?" },

This works in consumer apps because the switching cost is low and attention is the game. It doesn't work as well for AI products, because the AI is the product, and if the AI gets commoditised (it will), you need something underneath that isn't just the model." },

      { type: "paragraph", text: "The second question is: who benefits the most from this being automated? Not 'who would use it' but 'whose job or life gets materially better.' The gap between those two groups is where most AI products fail. They get used but not relied on." },

And then reality arrives." },

Nobody sees the nights you spent debugging that authentication flow. There's no receipt for the Saturday you spent designing the database schema.
